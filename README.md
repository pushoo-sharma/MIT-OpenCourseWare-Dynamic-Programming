What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique that can be used to solve many problems in time O(n2) or O(n3) for which a naive approach would take exponential time. (Usually to get running time below that—if it is possible—one would need to add other ideas as well.)

What is MIT OpenCourseWare?
